1. We have a table with employees and their salaries, however, 
some of the records are old and contain outdated salary information. 
Find the current salary of each employee assuming that salaries increase each year. Output their id,
first name, last name, department ID, and current salary. Order your list by employee ID in ascending order.

current_salaries = (
    ms_employee_salary.loc[
        ms_employee_salary.groupby('id')['salary'].idxmax()
    ]
    [['id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'department_id', 'salary']]
    .rename(columns={'salary': 'current_salary'})
    .sort_values('id')
)
alternate 

ms_employee_salary = ms_employee_salary.sort_values(
    by=['id', 'salary'], ascending=[True, False]
)

ms_employee_salary['rank'] = (
    ms_employee_salary
    .groupby('id')['salary']
    .rank(method='dense', ascending=False)
)
current_salaries = ms_employee_salary[ms_employee_salary['rank'] == 1]
current_salaries = current_salaries[
    ['id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'department_id', 'salary']
].rename(columns={'salary': 'current_salary'}).sort_values('id')



2. Count the number of movies for which Abigail Breslin was nominated for an Oscar.
oscar_nominees_filtered = oscar_nominees[oscar_nominees['nominee'].str.lower() == 'abigail breslin']
oscar_nominees_filtered['movie'].nunique()

3. Return the total number of comments received for each user in the 30-day period up to and including 2020-02-10. Don't output users who haven't received any comment in the defined time period.

fb_comments_count_filtered = fb_comments_count[
    (fb_comments_count['created_at'] >= '2020-01-12') &
    (fb_comments_count['created_at'] <= '2020-02-10')
]
comments_per_user = fb_comments_count_filtered.groupby('user_id')['number_of_comments'].sum().reset_index()
comments_per_user[comments_per_user['number_of_comments']>0]
