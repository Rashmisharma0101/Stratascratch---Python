1. Rank the top five customers by total purchase value. If multiple customers have the same total purchase value, 
treat them as ties 
and include all tied customers in the result. Display each customer's ID, total purchase value, and rank.
Ensure that the ranking does not skip numbers due to ties (e.g., if two customers share rank 2,
the next rank should be 3).

1. customer_purchase['rank']= customer_purchase['total_purchase_value'].rank(method = 'dense', ascending = False)
customer_purchase.loc[customer_purchase['rank'] <= 5].sort_values(by = 'rank')

2. Calculate the average score for each project, but only include projects where more than one team member has provided a score.

2.project_data['team_member_count'] = project_data.groupby('project_id')['team_member_id'].transform('count')
filtered = project_data[project_data['team_member_count'] > 1]

avg_score = filtered.groupby('project_id')['score'].mean().reset_index()

3. Count the unique activity types for each user, ensuring users with no activities are also included.
The output should show each user's ID and their activity type count, with zero for users who have no activities.

values = activity_log.groupby('user_id')['activity_type'].nunique().reset_index(name = 'activity_count')
merged = user_profiles.merge(values, on = 'user_id', how  = 'left')
merged['activity_count'] = merged['activity_count'].fillna(0).astype(int)
merged[['user_id','activity_count']]
